# Sparkberry

This repo is a helper project mostly aimed at learning spark and parallel computing for myself. This project simply contains a fabric (Python 2.8) file which will automate mosts of the tasks required to set up Hadoop and Spark on raspberry pis.

While targeted specifically at the a RPi2 cluster, there are no commands included which are RPi exclusive- except for usernames and passwords and whatnot. THis means you could modify this to setup a EC2/Azure/Whatever cluster quickly.

If any of these commands is broken, issue a pull request or make an issue.
